# SONIC_THE_HEDGEHOG
A Prototype for a Sonic the Hedgehog game in Unity

# Motive:

The motive behind this project is to provide a basis for which I am able to construct a Sonic the Hedgehog-esque game in Unity

Think of this as something that I may or may not be preparing for come 3rd year with the optional Game Development module
